# Derflinger

_デルフリンガー，Derufuringā_

Voice: Tetsuo Goto

Derflinger is the intelligent sword (Intelligence Sword) that Saito usually uses. Because its surface is in a state of disrepair, Louise bought it at a very low price and gave it to Saito as his companion sword. Saito calls it "Deru" and it refers to Saito as its "partner". It loves to talk. However, in the anime, it is not specified whether it can talk when it is put into the scabbard.
