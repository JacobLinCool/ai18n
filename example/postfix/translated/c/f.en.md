The male protagonist of the series, who comes from Tokyo, Japan on Earth to the world of the story. He was originally on his way to Akihabara to repair his laptop, but suddenly a strange object similar to a mirror appeared in front of him. When he touched it out of curiosity, he was sucked into this world[1] and immediately forced to make a familiar contract by Louise. The mark on his left hand is the rune letter "Gandalfr Gundolf", written in katakana as "ガンダールヴ" and pronounced as Gandāruvu (meaning "God's Left Hand・Gandalfr") and "God's Heart・Lífþrasir Eivíðsíður (リーヴスラシル)".
