# Derflinger

_デルフリンガー, Derufuringā_

Voiced by: Tetsuo Goto

The long sword that Saito usually uses is an intelligent sword called the Intelligence Sword. Because its surface is in a state of disrepair, Louise bought it at a very low price and gave it to Saito as his companion sword. Saito calls it "Derf" and it refers to Saito as its "partner". It loves to talk. However, in the anime, it is not specified whether it can talk when it is placed in its scabbard.
