Voiced by: [Satoshi Hino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Hino)

The male protagonist of the series, who comes from Tokyo, Japan on Earth to the world of the story. He was originally on his way to Akihabara to repair his laptop, but suddenly a strange object resembling a mirror appeared in front of him. Curious, he touched it with his hand and was sucked into this world[1], and was immediately forced by Louise to form a familiar contract. The mark on his left hand is the runic letters "Gandalfr Gundolf", written in katakana as "ガンダールヴ" and pronounced as "Gandāruvu" (meaning "God's Left Hand, Gandalfr") and "Lífþrasir Eiríkrsson" (リーヴスラシル, meaning "God's Heart, Lífþrasir Efdrísi").
