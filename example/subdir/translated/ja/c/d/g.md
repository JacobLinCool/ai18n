# Derufuringā

Voice: Tetsuo Goto

Derufuringā is the intelligent sword (Intelligence Sword) that Saito usually uses, which has self-awareness. Because its surface is in a state of disrepair, Louise bought it at a very low price and gave it to Saito as a companion sword. Saito calls it "Deru" and it refers to Saito as its "partner". It loves to talk. However, in the anime, it is not specified whether it can talk when it is placed in the scabbard.
